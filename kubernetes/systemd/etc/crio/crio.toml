# The workloads table defines ways to customize containers with different resources
# that work based on annotations, rather than the CRI.
# Note, the behavior of this table is EXPERIMENTAL and may change at any time.
# Each workload, has a name, activation_annotation, annotation_prefix and set of resources it supports mutating.
# The currently supported resources are "cpu" (to configure the cpu shares) and "cpuset" to configure the cpuset.
# Each resource can have a default value specified, or be empty.
# For a container to opt-into this workload, the pod should be configured with the annotation $activation_annotation (key only, value is ignored).
# To customize per-container, an annotation of the form $annotation_prefix.$resource/$ctrName = "value" can be specified
# signifying for that resource type to override the default value.
# If the annotation_prefix is not present, every container in the pod will be given the default values.
# Example:
# [crio.runtime.workloads.workload-type]
# activation_annotation = "io.crio/workload"
# annotation_prefix = "io.crio.workload-type"
# [crio.runtime.workloads.workload-type.resources]
# cpuset = 0
# cpushares = "0-1"
# Where:
# The workload name is workload-type.
# To specify, the pod must have the "io.crio.workload" annotation (this is a precise string match).
# This workload supports setting cpuset and cpu resources.
# annotation_prefix is used to customize the different resources.
# To configure the cpu shares a container gets in the example above, the pod would have to have the following annotation:
